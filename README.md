## Setup
All test cases are located in androidTest package, during the test implementation, dependency injection is being handled by Hilt
In order to run test cases, Virtual device (Emulator) or Physical device needs to be connected.

## Architecture
This app uses [***MVVM (Model View View-Model)***](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide#recommended-app-arch) architecture.
